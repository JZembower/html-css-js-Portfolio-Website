            <h2>About Information for Life</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Information for Life, a blog dedicated to sharing relevant, practical, and engaging insights from the intersections of my passions and daily experiences. Whether you're here for advice, inspiration, or just something to think about, my goal is to provide information that resonates with you and can be applied to your own life journey.</p>
            <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
            <p>My name is Jonah, and I’m currently an undergraduate student at Seton Hill University, pursuing a double major in Data Science and Exercise Science. These two fields might seem worlds apart, but I see them as complementary disciplines that fuel my curiosity and drive to uncover meaningful patterns—whether in numbers, human movement, or life itself.</p>
            <p>I have diverse interests that span a wide range of fields. My career aspirations include working with innovative organizations like NASA, applying data analytics to sports science, exploring customer data trends, and pursuing purposeful projects that combine my technical expertise with a positive impact on people’s lives. I’m passionate about uncovering new insights and solving problems in creative ways, and this blog is an extension of that spirit.</p>
            <h3>What Can You Expect Here?</h3>
            <p>Information for Life is your go-to resource for content inspired by my academic pursuits, hobbies, and everyday discoveries. Topics you’ll find on this blog include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data Science Insights: Tips, tools, and reflections on working with data—from exploratory analysis to creative applications in various industries.</li>
                <li>Health and Exercise Science: Evidence-based approaches to fitness, wellness, and biomechanics, designed to help you move and feel better.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>My aim is to connect my passion for learning and problem-solving with content that enriches your perspective and empowers you to take action.</p>
            <h3>A Little About Me</h3>
            <p>Beyond academics, I’m someone who thrives on exploring the world around me. I love playing piano, guitar, and singing—music is one of my creative outlets that keeps me grounded. When I’m not diving into datasets or biomechanics, you might find me on the basketball court, playing soccer, or engaging in other physical activities that challenge both body and mind.</p>
            <p>I’m also deeply curious about faith and history, particularly exploring the Bible and the Christian tradition. These interests help me reflect on purpose and meaning, both in my personal life and in my work.</p>
