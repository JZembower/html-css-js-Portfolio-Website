                        Hi, my name is Jonah Zembower. I am a student at Seton Hill University majoring in data science and exercise science. 
                        I was a soccer team member at Seton Hill for two years, and I am now beginning to perform heart rate monitor research to attribute how heart rate variability is affected in various exercises and games for the men's soccer team.
                        I plan to publish this research when it is completed near my graduation in May 2025. I have also been acknowledged on the Dean's List for obtaining at least a 3.7 GPA at Seton Hill five times and awarded the Data Science Achievement Award 2 times. 
                        At Seton Hill, I have taken a heavy courseload in deep mathematics, programming, physiology, and other classes. Also, I have attended three MARC ACSM conferences with other Seton Hill students to view the latest research in exercise science. 
                        Overall, I am a student who always aspires to grow in my knowledge, and I am currently working on personal projects/learning related to my future aspirations in the space industry. 
                        Furthermore, I am currently available to do free data analysis for any company that would want to outsource their work.
